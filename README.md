<h3 align="center">NHN Injeinc frontend developer</h3>

Hello,
I am Younghoon Kim, a frontend developer with one year of experience.

In July 2023, I joined Pandora TV as part of the Cobak team, where I handled various frontend tasks. My responsibilities included updating legacy webview and web code to modern standards, optimizing performance, developing business pages, and converting layouts into responsive web designs.

Currently, I am working at NHN Injeinc as a frontend developer, where I have been building in-house projects from scratch and developing various common components using headless architecture.

Additionally, I actively contribute to open-source projects by responding to issues, aiming not just to use open-source tools but to deeply understand and engage with them..
